Hey there! Great start with your Java program! It's concise and gets straight to the point. Let's dive into a quick
review to make it even more robust and professional.

### üêû Debugger Mode: Spotting the Runtime Rumble

You've hit upon a classic runtime error that every programmer encounters at some point!

* **The Problem:** Your code attempts to divide `a` (which is `5`) by `b` (which is `0`). In mathematics, division by
zero is undefined, and in programming, it typically leads to a nasty crash.
* **The Error:** When you run this, you'll get an `ArithmeticException: / by zero`. This is a runtime exception, meaning
the compiler won't warn you, but your program will crash when that line executes.

**Here's how it would look if you ran it:**

```
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
at Main.main(Main.java:5) // Line 5: int result = a / b;
```

### ‚ö° Optimizer Mode: Preventing Crashes Gracefully

Instead of letting the program crash, we can anticipate this potential error and handle it gracefully.

**Solution: Using a `try-catch` block for Exception Handling**

This pattern allows you to "try" a block of code and "catch" specific exceptions if they occur.

```java
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int a = 5;
int b = 0; // Still zero for demonstration

try {
int result = a / b;
System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
System.err.println("Error: Cannot divide by zero!"); // Use System.err for errors
// You can also print the stack trace for debugging:
// e.printStackTrace();
}

System.out.println("Program finished."); // This line will execute even if an error occurred
}
}
```

**Output of the corrected code:**

```
Error: Cannot divide by zero!
Program finished.
```

This way, your program informs the user about the issue and can continue executing other parts of the code, rather than
just terminating abruptly.

### üéì Mentor Mode: Building Robust Applications

1. **Robust Error Handling:** The `try-catch` block is your best friend for handling runtime exceptions. It makes your
code more resilient. For user input, you'd typically validate *before* attempting the operation.
* **Pro-tip:** For division, it's often better to check `if (b != 0)` *before* the division if `b` could reasonably be
zero, rather than relying solely on `try-catch` (which is for truly unexpected errors).

```java
// A more proactive approach (often preferred for expected conditions)
public class Main {
public static void main(String[] args) {
int a = 5;
int b = 0;

if (b != 0) {
int result = a / b;
System.out.println("Result: " + result);
} else {
System.err.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
}
}
}
```

2. **Code Readability & Formatting:** Java has widely accepted formatting conventions. Even for small snippets, keeping
consistent indentation and spacing makes your code much easier to read and understand for yourself and others.
* **Recommendation:** Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or VS Code with the Java Extension Pack. They have built-in
formatters (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+L in IntelliJ, Shift+Alt+F in VS Code) that will instantly format your code to professional
standards.

3. **Variable Naming:** While `a` and `b` are fine for this simple example, in real-world code, using descriptive names
(e.g., `numerator`, `denominator`, `dividend`, `divisor`) significantly improves clarity.

**üî• Pro Tip:** Did you know you can quickly run single Java files from your terminal without explicitly compiling with
`javac` first? If you have JDK 11 or later, simply use `java YourFileName.java`! It compiles and runs in one go.

Keep up the great work! Every error is a learning opportunity, and handling them gracefully is a mark of a skilled
developer. You're doing awesome!
